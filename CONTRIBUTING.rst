Survey
^^^^^^

Please first fill out this VERY brief survey about the consent forms
for your studies: http://goo.gl/forms/2lsmYcOsAs . It only has a few
questions and should take a few minutes to fill out.  Even if
your consent form doesn't yet include any provision for data sharing,
your contribution would be very valuable (although it would consist of
simply saying "No").

Additional Materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We're always looking for new materials to add to this shared neuroimaging resource.  In particular, we're looking for:

- Samples of consent forms allowing re-distribution/deposit to
  public archives

- Relevant publications and discussions

- Changes/recommendations for the **ultimate** consent form formulation

To add to the materials on this site, please open an issue on our `GitHub issues`_ page or send a new pull request via `GitHub pull requests`_.  Whether or not you should open an issue or make a pull request depends on the type of contribution you are making.

For sample consent forms and links to relevant publications, please make submissions exclusively via the `GitHub issues`_ page.  When submitting consent forms, please include a full URL to the form and the desired filename you'd like to see it represented as on the :ref:`chap_consent_samples` page.  Note that for the URL you submit, `persistent URLs`_ such as `DOIs`_ are ideal, since these will not require frequent updates to this site in the event that a link moves.  If a consent form does not have a DOI associated with it, an `Internet Archive Wayback Machine`_ saved page also works well in practice.

Changes to the ultimate consent form should be made via `GitHub pull requests`_.

IRB committee members
---------------------

We would welcome your feedback very much, in particular:

- What concerns on public sharing of neuroimaging data you might have
  if all identifiable information is removed (e.g. skull stripped) and
  research participants agreed to those terms.

- What particular consent form composition and wording aspects would
  you recommend (e.g. "make it an explicit additional form requiring
  a separate signature") and why?


Speaking multiple languages?
----------------------------

Please file an issue on `GitHub Issues`_ mentioning languages you
would like to contribute or help maintain translations for, or simply
propose a PR with the translation. We will be happy for you to join
our Internationalization (`i18n`) teams.


Versioning
----------

All Open Brain Constent (OBC) documents now follow following
versioning schema:

`OBC-<NAME>[.translation] MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- `MAJOR` - boost when introducing major changes
- `MINOR` - any change which might already require translations review/update
- `PATCH` - language-specific minor fixes

Translations must use `MAJOR.MINOR` component from the corresponding
English version of the document.

`.PATCH` is incremented in English version only if change does not
require translations update (e.g., a typo).

`.PATCH` is incremented in translations upon any tune up of
translation from its previous state for the same `MAJOR.MINOR`
version.
