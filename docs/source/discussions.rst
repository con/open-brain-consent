  Furthermore, I agree that my anonymised data may be made available
  to a central MRI data centre. A data centre is an Internet server
  for anonymised MRI data and makes published image data accessible to
  researchers around the world. This allows further supplementary
  processing and repeated analyses. It also serves the purpose of
  making the results more transparent and accelerating the progress of
  research in the brain sciences. Some scientific journals already
  make the on-line availability of data a prerequisite for
  publication.

  Thanks for sharing the template ! I tried to get such a paragraph in
  a consent form three years ago, and after one year of discussion
  with the IRB I had finally to remove it. I found that at least at my
  institution it is very important to describe the data repository,
  data use agreement and anonymization strategy (as well as other
  variables shared in addition to imaging) in order to get approval.

  Thanks! That adds some facets that I haven't used in mine before.
  Another aspect that I found necessary is to inform participants that
  data is actually accessible by anyone, not just scientists -- this
  avoids concerns regarding access permissions and authentication.
  Moreover, at least in Germany participants can change their mind on
  the data sharing permission and can ask for their data to be removed
  from a database -- even if it may not have an actual effect on
  privacy once data were out in the open.  Lastly, I can confirm that
  information on what kind of data are shared is important, and at
  least a rough idea what kind of anonymization strategy is used.  Ah
  and, not giving permission to share data must not lead to
  "disadvantages" for a person -- this is mandated by law in
  Germany. Not sure what this means in the context of a scientific
  study, but I would not exclude a participant solely based on his or
  her unwillingness to share data.

  In UK it's getting crazy. For our data bank we are planning
  de-identification ie face and ear removal and or scrubbing, you know
  is case your insurance company decides to make 3d models of data,
  recognize you, and found something weird in your brain that our
  radiologists and neurologist haven't seen before ...
